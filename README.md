# DataCaptureTool

In partial fulfillment of CSC3002S, my team developed an Android tablet tool to assist the qualitative process
of conducting interviews and annotating themes in situ. Major features included:
- Bookmarking and theme identification in real time
- audio capture and time stamping of annotations
- Export to ASP.net MVC adminstrative website
- Post processing Web tool for interviews supporting CRUD functionality
